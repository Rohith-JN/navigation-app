# Navigation App

## Overview
This is a **React Native Expo** application that allows users to:
- View their **current location** on a map.
- **Search for locations** using OpenStreetMap's Nominatim API.
- Display a **route from the user's location to the searched location** using Google Maps Directions API.

## Features
- **User Location Tracking:** Automatically detects and displays the user's location.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can enter a location name, and the app finds and displays it on the map.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Draws a route between the userâ€™s location and the searched location.
- **Interactive Map:** Supports zooming and panning.
- **Marker Customization:** User location is marked in blue, and the searched location is marked with a pin.

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Expo CLI** (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- **Google Maps API Key** (for Directions API usage)
